# Compatibility & Edge Cases

This document tracks compatibility goals with:

- Streamdown (block splitting + termination behavior)
- Incremark (stable boundary detection + streaming edge cases)
- pulldown-cmark ecosystem (optional adapter)

## Scope Rule

`mdstream` follows a strict scope boundary:

- If Streamdown's `parseMarkdownIntoBlocks` supports a streaming-stability behavior at the block
  boundary level, `mdstream` must support it (with stable `committed + pending` semantics).
- If Streamdown does not support it (e.g. provider-specific tool calls, message parts, citations as
  business semantics), `mdstream` does not implement it in the core library.

Any behavior outside Streamdown parity must be explicitly agreed as project scope before adding.

## Streamdown parity checklist (block splitting)

Baseline: `repo-ref/streamdown/packages/streamdown/lib/parse-blocks.tsx`.

- Basic parsing: headings + paragraphs (covered: `tests/stream_streamdown_basic_parsing.rs`)
- Code fences: ``` / ~~~ (covered: `tests/stream_streamdown_code_blocks.rs`)
- Math blocks: `$$ ... $$` (covered: `tests/stream_block_splitting.rs`)
- HTML blocks: conservative merge with tag stack (covered: `tests/stream_streamdown_html_blocks.rs`)
- Footnotes: if any footnotes exist, return single block (covered: `tests/stream_block_splitting.rs`)
- Tables: GFM delimiter row (covered: `tests/stream_streamdown_tables.rs`)
- Streaming simulation (covered: `tests/stream_streamdown_simulation.rs`)
- Streaming parity (incremental vs full re-parse): (covered: `tests/stream_streamdown_streaming_simulation_parity.rs`)
- Mixed content scenario (covered: `tests/stream_streamdown_mixed_content.rs`)

### Streamdown benchmark coverage

The Streamdown benchmark suite `repo-ref/streamdown/packages/streamdown/__benchmarks__/parse-blocks.bench.ts`
is tracked by the following tests:

- `Basic Parsing` -> `tests/stream_streamdown_basic_parsing.rs`
- `Code Blocks` -> `tests/stream_streamdown_code_blocks.rs`
- `Math Blocks` -> `tests/stream_block_splitting.rs`
- `HTML Blocks` -> `tests/stream_streamdown_html_blocks.rs`
- `Footnotes` -> `tests/stream_block_splitting.rs`
- `Tables` -> `tests/stream_streamdown_tables.rs`
- `Streaming Simulation` -> `tests/stream_streamdown_simulation.rs` and `tests/stream_streamdown_streaming_simulation_parity.rs`
- `Mixed Content` -> `tests/stream_streamdown_mixed_content.rs`

## Known differences vs Streamdown (documented)

Streamdown's block splitting uses `marked` tokenization plus a small post-merge step
(`repo-ref/streamdown/packages/streamdown/lib/parse-blocks.tsx`). `mdstream` implements a
streaming-first line scanner. As a result, there are some intentional differences:

- HTML tag detection:
  - Streamdown uses regexes like `/<(\\w+)[\\s>]/` and `/<\\/(\\w+)>/` (tag name = `\\w+`).
  - `mdstream` recognizes ASCII tag names that start with a letter and continue with
    alphanumerics/`_`. This is closer to CommonMark-style HTML blocks and avoids many false positives
    in chat-like text, while still matching Streamdown's `\\w+` for most practical cases.
- HTML stack handling:
  - Streamdown only pops one closing tag per `html` token and does not attempt to parse multiple tags
    within one token.
  - `mdstream` scans each line and maintains a best-effort stack (multiple tags per line supported).
- HTML comments:
  - Streamdown behavior depends on `marked` tokenization (comments may or may not be merged depending
    on how tokens are produced).
  - `mdstream` treats multi-line `<!-- ... -->` as a single HTML block for stability.
- Tables/lists/blockquote nuances:
  - Streamdown relies on `marked`'s idea of tables/lists/quotes.
  - `mdstream` uses lightweight heuristics designed to be chunking-invariant; some non-benchmark edge
    cases may split differently.
  - Streaming-only stability tweaks exist to preserve chunking invariance (e.g. avoiding premature
    list commits when a list marker is split across chunks).

These differences are acceptable as long as Streamdown benchmark parity tests and chunking invariance
tests remain green (see `tests/chunking_invariance_suite.rs`).

## Streaming edge cases (must handle)

### Incomplete inline constructs

- emphasis markers: `*`, `**`, `***`, `_`, `__`
- inline code: backticks
- strikethrough: `~~`
- links/images:
  - incomplete URL
  - incomplete link text with nested brackets

### Block constructs spanning chunks

- fenced code blocks
- blockquotes + lists (nested)
- HTML blocks
- tables
- math blocks with `$$`
- footnote definitions with continuation indentation

## Footnotes and reference definitions

These constructs are document-scoped and can force either:

- stability-first behavior (single block)
- invalidation behavior (selective re-parse in adapters)

The chosen default should prioritize streaming stability.

`mdstream` may emit `Update { reset: true, .. }` when entering SingleBlock footnote mode mid-stream so
consumers can drop cached blocks and rebuild (Streamdown parity behavior).

## Non-standard and ecosystem behaviors

### Incomplete link placeholder

Streamdown uses a special URL marker: `streamdown:incomplete-link`.

`mdstream` should:

- default to the same marker for compatibility
- allow configuring it

### Images

Streamdown removes incomplete images (because partial images cannot display meaningfully).

`mdstream` should support the same default behavior.
